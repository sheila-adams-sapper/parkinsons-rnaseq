# Parkinson's Disease RNA-seq Interactive Dashboard

This repository contains an interactive dashboard for exploring RNA-seq results from Parkinson's disease research.

## Live Dashboard
- **Static Dashboard**: https://sheila-adams-sapper.github.io/parkinsons-rnaseq/
- **Interactive Features**: Volcano plots, pathway analysis, gene expression tables

## Key Results
- Directional pathway analysis showing up/down-regulated pathways
- Differential expression between Parkinson's vs controls  
- Exercise training effects (pre vs post)

## Data
Based on published study: doi: 10.3389/fphys.2020.00653
